//theory :: to get nth bit and toggle nth bit.



/* theory ::
First of all a mask is created having only nth bit as set bit by using inbuilt pow function.

Firstly, Bitwise AND operation is performed between given number(num) and mask.
If this value is greater than 0 it means nth bit is set else not set.

Afterwards, Bitwise XOR is performed between given number(num) and mask. 
This will simply toggle the nth bit .
