/*theory ::/*taking a float value x and printing two integers which are
just smaller and greater than x.*/


/* PROGRAM LOGIC :;  first we are taking the input i.e the float value of x 
and then simply using the concept of "typecasting".
using typecasting , converting float datatype to integer and hence it will 
ignore the value after decimal point and will get   just smaller number.

now  x+1 will increase its value by one and again converting it to integer datatype,we get
the just greater number.*/



#include<stdio.h>
int main (){
float x;
scanf("%f",&x);
printf("%d\n %d",(int)x,(int)x+1);
       
       


   
       return 0;
}
