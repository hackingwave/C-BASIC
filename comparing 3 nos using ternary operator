//   question 3::
 
 
 /*Theory:: we have given the 3 numbers and we have to find the
 greatest and the smallest number among them*/
 
 

/*PROGRAM LOGIC ::   we took the input of 3 numbers and then by using ternary operator
we compared the first two numbers.
now ,we found the greatest/smallest(result1) among the first two numbers AND now
we compared this result1 with the third number.*/
