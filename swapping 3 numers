//   question 2::the program to make following exchanges a-->b-->c-->a.
 
 
 
 //THEORY::
 
 //swappping the three(a,b,c) numbers.
 // b is to assume the value of a.
 // c is to assume the value of b.
 // a is to assume the value of c.

//PROGRAM LOGIC ::

/* at first , we swapped the values of a and b.
now a=b and b=a(requied) .
now ,
we swapped the values of b and c
so, c=a (required) and a=c( a was equal to b, this implies c=b (required)
hence; b=a,c=b,a =c*/
