//   question 4::
 
 
 /*Theory:: program that returns 'x' with n digit that begin at position 'p' inverted ,
 leaving the others unchanged*/
 
 

/*PROGRAM LOGIC ::  we took the number x,
then the value p .
now we divided the x into two parts left_half that is to be  reversed and 
the right_half that is to be  left unchanged
1) we applied loop to the right_half and reversed the number
2) we applied loop to  the left_half and reversed the number
3) in third loop, we kept the  reversed left_half as it is and , again reversed ,the reversed the right_half 
and appended it to the left_half */
